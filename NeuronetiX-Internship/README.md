# NeuronetiX Internship

## Overview

This folder contains projects and materials from my Machine Learning Internship at NeuronetiX. The internship was part of ABDELGHAFOR’S VIRTUAL INTERNSHIPS, hosted by NeuronetiX in collaboration with Computopia Academy and HCODE, with partners including AIESEC Egypt in Cairo University and IEEE Benha University.

NeuronetiX is a leading technology firm known for its innovative solutions in machine learning, data analysis, and various other tech fields. This internship provided me with valuable hands-on experience and exposure to cutting-edge technologies.

## Internship Experience

During my time at NeuronetiX, I worked on several key areas:

- **Supervised Learning Models**: Developed and fine-tuned models using supervised learning techniques.
- **Unsupervised Learning Techniques**: Applied clustering and dimensionality reduction methods to analyze and interpret data.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Explored RL algorithms to solve complex problems and optimize decision-making processes.
- **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Focused on evaluating model performance and optimizing algorithms for better accuracy and efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdallaellaithy/Machine-Learning-Internship-Projects.git
    ```
## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the NeuronetiX Folder:**
```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Internship-Projects/NeuronetiX-Internship
```
## Acknowledgments

- **NeuronetiX**: Thank you for offering me the chance to work on impactful projects and gain hands-on experience.
- **Mentors and Colleagues**: Special thanks to all mentors and colleagues who supported me throughout the internship.
